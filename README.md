# Image Driven Product Search for Ecommerce

## Building a Reverse Image Product Search application using Qdrant Similarity Search, OpenAI CLIP and Gradio.
The dataset is taken from Kaggle which is an Ecommerce Product Image dataset. You can visit this [file](data.txt) to see the dataset and construct the files accordingly. 

Clone this repository and install the [dependencies](requirements.txt).

Run the Python [file](app.py).
There are two Gradio Interfaces:
1. Reverse Image Product Search
2. Image Search using Product Category
   
You'll see the running application in two tabs.

**Tab 0:** ![](assets/Tab1.jpg)
**Tab 1:** ![](assets/Tab0.jpg)

Try a reverse image search by uploading an image and getting images of the products from the selected product categories.
